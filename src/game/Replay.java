	//my idea is that we display this instead of the normal game when they choose to replay.
	//a Replay object would be created when they click replay, and would be initialized with:
	//	ball initial position
	//	force of shot
	//other class variables:
	//	replay speed (can be altered using pause() probably idk)
	//	?
